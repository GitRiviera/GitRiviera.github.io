            To order products from LaserBio Labs please consult our catalog and
            email us a Purchase Order from your Company or Institution. We also
            accept email orders from repeat customers. Orders by fax or postal
            service are also accepted.<br><br>

            To request a quote or additional administrative information please
            contact us by email with your product requirements.<br><br>

            We do not request pre-payment of orders. An invoice is sent
            electronically at the time of shipment, including bank account
            information.<br><br>

            All prices are quoted and invoiced exclusively in EUROS. Payment
            must be made in EUROS by direct bank transfer.<br><br>

            All transfer-related bank fees should be borne by the paying
            organization. LaserBio Labs will not accept the deduction of bank
            fees from the amount invoiced. In such case, another invoice
            including additional bank fees may be emitted or the bank fees may
            be added to the customer's next order.
