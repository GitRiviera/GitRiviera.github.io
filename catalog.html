            <p>
            Kit IMG-001 is designed for MALDI imaging applications with the Applied Biosystems / Sciex 4800 and 5800 MALDI TOF/TOF systems. The kit contains a specially designed microscope slide adaptor based on an Opti-TOF® LC-MALDI insert. The insert holds two microscope slides for MALDI imaging experiments.
            <br><br>
In order to facilitate the setup of imaging experiments and provide a complete solution, the kit also contains the following components:
<br>
- 25 ITO-coated conductive microscope slides. LaserBio Labs offers ITO slides marked on the conductive side for easier handling
<br>
- 25 pieces of water-sensitive paper for spray control. The water-sensitive paper is coated with a chemical that turns blue when sprayed with liquid. The papers are the size of miscroscope slides and will allow for optimization of matrix spray conditions.
<br>
- 25 pieces of double-side adhesive conductive tape. The tape is used to ensure electrical contact of the microscope slides with the adapter and to mount tissue or material without glass slides.
<br>
- 50 pieces of double-sided adhesive to affix the microscope slides in Opti-TOF® holder
<br>
- A Matrix & Calibrants MALDI Imaging starter pack. The pack includes peptides and protein mixes for calibration of samples in the small molecule, peptide and protein mass ranges. MALDI matrix (CHCA and SA) is also included for method development
