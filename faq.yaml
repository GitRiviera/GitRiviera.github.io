In the latter case no parcel tracking can be offered<br><br>All products are shipped at room temperature

    answer: Delivery time is normally 1 to 5 days with FEDEX depending on the country of destination. Please contact us for specific information

    answer: Unfortunately not. We do not accept credit card payments anymore as too few customers are using this means of payment

  - question: Can I get a discount on my order?
    answer: LaserBio Labs' pricing policy is to offer the right price for its products and not to artificially inflate the catalog list prices in order to offer discounts as a marketing strategy. Prices are therefore not discounted. For large orders superior to 1000.00 Euros, please contact us
